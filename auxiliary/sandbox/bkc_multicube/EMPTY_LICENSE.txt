x1. Terms

"Work" means the composition which was made by an individual or a group. 
The scope of the "work" includes but more than pragrams, and any other forms 
of composition such as musical compositions, drawings, writings, project 
plans are also included in it.

"contributor" means both the original author of the work and all other 
related person who make the contribution of different forms to the work.

"receiver" is an individual or a group who get the work via the network 
or other method.

"commercial group" is the group of which the aims are money-making oriented, 
and often have it's own product, or only have the capital. A commercial 
group could even have only one person. A commercial group includes but more 
than companies and corporations of different forms.



x2. Basic Principle

The works can always be gotten integrally and freely by everyone via 
network or other methods. 'Freely' includes without any payment. 

For programs, this means that the program will always be source opened, 
and can always be gotten freely via network or other methods when needed.



x3. Non-Profit Use of The Works

Everyone who gets the work can use it freely at once.
'Freely' includes without any payment and in any methods.

For programs, this means that some new programs based on the received program
need not to publish all their sources thoroughly, and you are guaranteed 
that you really have the rights to do this. However, the following 
section(x3.Commercial Use of The Works) can be referenced if you choose to do 
this for commercial use.

A declaration of the use of the received program is recommended as the 
respects to the original and all other relative contributors for the received 
program.  



x4. Commercial Use of The Works

There is always a simple rule:
The commercial group must pay the real-value of the work 
to the participants who participates in the commercial group.

The participants includes employees and employers in the commercial group
The real-value calculation is descripted separately in the following 
part of this section.

For totally reuse of the received works, the commercial group must pay the 
real-value of the works to all the participants in itself evenly. 
This means that every participant will get a partial value as the amount of 
(real-value / number of all participants).

For partially referencing to the received works to some extent, it is 
guaranteed that the reference person will have the rights to estimate the 
value of the referencing according to the total real-value of the received 
works as the initial value, and that all other participants in the commercial
group have the rights to vote, oppose or suggest a new reasonable estimation. 
However, the initial value can not exceed the real-value of the received work.

If an estimation encounters no opposition for a period of time, it becomes 
the steady estimation. During the exchanging of opinions, the estimation is 
the initial value. After a steady estimation turns up, the estimation is 
the steady one.

After all, the commercial group must also pay the estimation value of the 
works to all the participants in itself evenly. This means that every 
participant will get a partial value as the amount of (estimation-value / 
number of all participants).

There is always a talkpage designated by the original author for the work , 
it can be a plain file  or an web page on the network or in any other forms.
the real-value and value-realize-period of the work can be brought up from 
here.

The real-value calculation is as follows:

Every contributor of the work will give a number of his/her lifetime spent on
this work and another number as the estimated value(measured in money or other 
counterpart form). the real-value of the work is dynamically increased as 
more and more contributor joins in and reduce when each contribution has
lasted over nature-life-span-time. 
"nature-life-span-time" means the time span during which each contribution 
can bring value to every one, and
after the nature-life-span-time has passed, the work is still an open source
to every one but these noble contribution will not contribute to the real-value
of the work. The value of nature-life-span-time is 100 years for which the 
current human life limit is considered.

Payment period is the decided by value-realize-period declared in the 
specific work. 
This means that the commercial group will have to pay the real-value or 
the estimation-value of the work to it's participants per value-realize-period. 
During the exchanging of opinions, the value-realize-period is the initial one. 
Value-realize-period will be brought up from the talkpage just like the 
real-value.

The determination of the value-realize-period is initially brought up by the 
original author of the work, and it is guaranteed that everyone have the 
rights to vote, oppose or suggest a new reasonable value-realize-period.

If the work is updated, and the commercial group take the use of the new 
version, the sum of the payment need to be updated according to the 
responding upadated real-value or estimation-value of the work.

A declaration of the use of the received works is recommended a respect to 
the original and all other relative contributors for the received works.


There is also an integrity assurance:

If the commercial group take the commercial use of the works, but does not 
perform responsibilities described above, it is guaranteed that everyone 
could have the rights to reveal this deal, and also have the rights to resort
to law or other contemporary counterpart to enforce these responsibility.
And in these cases, everyone is guarenteed to have the rights to demand the 
value which originally need to be paid to the participants to be doubled 
relative to the former value per value-realize-period untill the 
nature-life-span-time of the works has passed or the person who made this 
demand choose to stop doing this.



x5. Warranty

There is two generation of the warranty system:

First Generation

The time span may at least lasts 20 years, 
we can tag this time span as 2010.02.24---2030.02.24.

This time span is needed that the members under the EMPTY LICENCE can 
grow up safely, and supply everyone with more and more functions freely. 
At the same time, an open donation pool will be built to absorb value 
donated by everyone.

During this time span, there is rich technical and relative supports 
for the works from the original author and all other contributors. 
The receiver will assume the risk as to the quality and performance 
of the work, and the original author and relative contributors need not 
to assume this risk(except the  author or the contributors make 
a warranty for the work).
Once a loss occurred and is affirmed, the compensation 
to the receiver is recorded, and will be realized during the 
second generation.

In fact, the work which is open to everyone will have less defects than 
those close ones. And the open source project GNU/linux can give us 
the explanation to some extent. We must have a sober mind that 
more advertising does not lead to less defects, it is the responsibility 
and a good management method that can lead to less defects.


Second Generation

The receivers of the work can not only get rich technical and 
relative supports for the work but also the adequate compensation for the 
loss that occurred and is affirmed to the receiver due to the robustness 
and thriving of the open donation pool. 
The original author and relative contributors need not to assume the 
risk as to the quality and performance of the work(except the author or 
the contributors make a warranty for the work).

The strong will is to initiatively and thoughtfully compensate the receiver 
once a loss occurs, and buck-passing will always be despised.
During this generation, the cumulated and unresolved compensation recorded in
the first generation will be resolved thoughtfully for the corresponding 
receivers or their relatives in some cases.

This will be a vivid contrast and big bang to some of the commercial groups
of which the first strategy to the loss of their customers is buck-passing.



x6. Apply EMPTY LICENSE to Your Works

The position can be a description file belongs to the work, or a description
web page for the work or can be of other choice.

For program, this declaration is recommended to attach
to the start of the main description of the program, such
as README of the program. 

Each file of the program should have at least the 
"Copyright Declaration" line and a pointer to where the full notice can
be found.
