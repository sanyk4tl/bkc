how to build and use bkc
========================
 
a. platform dependency:
 
  currently bkc has been built on ubuntu 9.04(linux os)
 
  toolchains requirement:
    c99 or c89 compiler such as gcc
    make program such as gnu make
    shell program such as bash
 
b. fast building and testing

  for building the libbkc.a
  #cd bkc/build
  #./configure
  #make
  #make test

  then libbkc.a will be in the bkc/out directory, and all the head
  files is in the bkc/include.
 
  the executable file bkc_test_main will be in the bkc/test/bkc_test 
  and the test source file is in the  bkc/test/bkc_test_main.c


b. specific building and testing
 
  for building the libbkc.a
  #cd bkc/build
  #./configure
  #make
  then libbkc.a will be in the bkc/out directory, and all the head
  files is in the bkc/include.
 
  for testing libbkc.a
  #cd bkc/build
  #make test
  then the executable file bkc_test_main will be in the 
  bkc/test/bkc_test the test source file is in the 
  bkc/test/bkc_test_main.c
 
  for rebuilding the libbkc.a
  if make changes in every single module, and want to rebuild the
  libbkc.a can execute
  #make clean
  #make

  for building a single module
  if want to build a single module independently such as
  libbkc_string.a
  in bkc_string module
  #cd bkc/src/bkc_string/build
  #./configure
  #make
  then libbkc_string.a will be in bkc/src/bkc_string/lib directory
 
  for testing a single module
  #cd bkc/src/bkc_string/build
  #make
  #make test
  then the executable file bkc_string_test_main will be in the
  bkc/src/bkc_string/test, the src file  is in the
  bkc/src/bkc_string/test/bkc_string_test_main.c
  if make changes in the test file or in the src files with
  the module lib,
  then can type
  #make clean ; make; make test
  to rebuild the libbkc_string.a and bkc_string_test_main
 
c. usage
  normally , the caller can only include bkc.h ,
  and all the facilities supplied by bkc can be available.
  more, the caller can also only include a single
  head file such as bkc_string.h for definitely use the designated
  module.
