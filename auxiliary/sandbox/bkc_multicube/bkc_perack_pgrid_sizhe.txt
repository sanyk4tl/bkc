permanent acknowledgement
=========================
 
thanks to lxd who can always ignite my curiosity in coding, without
this ignition, i will have been weary.
 
thanks to yan who always keep me reminding:
   a coder must keep coding when others are not.
 
thanks to DLV who can always inject strong strength for me to stand
on my own in those busy and normal lifes. more, those sincere trust and
free time are really really precious to me.
 
thanks to qyu who always sit silently on my side, and be ready
to answer my any questions.
 
thanks to wp who supply me the notebook in the first few months,
as well as to the disagreement between us in most of the time. 
in fact, these disagreements can always bring me a more clear 
volition and some usefull prompts.
