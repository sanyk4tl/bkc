how to build and use bkc
========================
 
a. platform dependency:
 
  currently bkc has been built on ubuntu 9.04(linux os)
 
  toolchains requirement:
    c99 or c89 compiler such as gcc
    make program such as gnu make
    shell program such as bash
 
b. fast building and testing

  for building the libbkc.a
  #cd bkc/build
  #./configure
  #make
  #make test

  then libbkc.a will be in the bkc/out directory, and all the head
  files is in the bkc/include.
 
  the executable file bkc_test_main will be in the bkc/test/bkc_test 
  and the test source file is in the  bkc/test/bkc_test_main.c
 
c. usage
  normally , the caller can only include bkc.h ,
  and all the facilities supplied by bkc can be available.
  more, the caller can also only include a single
  head file such as bkc_string.h for definitely use the designated
  module.

  for more detailed building information,such as build a specific module,
